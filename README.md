**Note**: Early development / alpha, use at your own risk.

This package adds caching functionality to [HTTPX](https://github.com/encode/httpx)

Adapted from Eric Larson's fantastic [CacheControl](https://github.com/ionrock/cachecontrol) for [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Project goals:
- [x] Sans-io caching protocol
- [x] Fully async compatible
- [ ] Support multiple http clients (currently only supports httpx)

Limitations:
* Currently only has in-memory cache storage (async redis would be nice!)
* Test suite was taken wholesale from CacheControl, so still uses a test server and mocking rather than taking advantage of the sans-io implementation. 

**Usage:**

```python
import asyncio

from httpx import AsyncClient
from httpx_caching import CachingClient

client = AsyncClient()
client = CachingClient(client)

async def run_example():
    await client.get("http://example.com")
    
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(run_example())
```

Or with Redis as cache backend:

```python
client = CachingClient(client, cache=AsyncRedisCache())
```

**Documentation:**

TODO

See [CacheControl's documentation](https://cachecontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for general documentation of the caching approach.
